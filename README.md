**gigamajig** is a platform for freelancers and independent contractors to offer their services to the platform's users, and to browse other service providers and hire their services, as well. Users managing storefronts can set and display their available dates and times to customers, using a store calendar interface.

Upon authenticating via **Google OAuth**, users are presented with their personal dashboard, where they can **create new stores** or **manage existing stores**, as well as return to stores from whom they've previously hired services, at a convenient glance. A user's personal availability is managed via their **calendar**:
